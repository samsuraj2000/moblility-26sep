Most countries are putting stringent rules on waste management, including forcing recycling and less use of landfills. Under the EU's Waste Framework Directive, 55 percent of municipal waste is estimated to be recycled in 2025, and targets set for 2030 are even steeper. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other agencies worldwide are also doing their best in order to promote recycling.

Rise in E-commerce and Demand for Packaging: There has been a boom in demand for cardboard packaging materials due to increased e-commerce activities. The upward trend has enforced recycling used cardboard as essential for companies in achieving sustainability for sustainability purposes, along with controlling costs. Thus, the upsurge was more vigorous with the COVID-19 pandemic when the customers shifted their shopping to online platforms, thereby leading to an increase in packaging wastes that have to be managed effectively.

Economic Advantages: Cardboard recycling can help save on the cost of waste disposal, reduce the use of virgin material, and make money from the recycled product. Often times it is cheaper to recycle than not to.

Challenges Confronting the Market
Even though there are a number of market expansion drivers, the cardboard recycling market also has some challenges:

Contamination in the Recycling Stream: Most of the time, contamination of recyclables is one of the major problems during the cardboard recycling process. Food residues, oils, among other contaminants make it unrecyclable. This poses a challenge in the food packaging and consumer use cases. These generally proved to be one of the tough cases for high-quality recycling outcomes.

Collection and Sorting Effectiveness: Collection and sorting of recyclables are the most crucial elements for the financial viability of recycling programs. However, poor infrastructure, especially in developing countries, compounds the problem of inefficiencies in collecting recyclable materials. Technologies for sorting have improved significantly, although human manual sorting is pricey and time consuming.

Volatility in Markets for Recycled Cardboard While the supply and demand for recycled cardboard are inherently somewhat volatile, their impact on the prices of this material cannot be relied upon. Downswings in the economy or spurts/declines in industrial activity will suppress demand for recycled cardboard; and price volatility in virgin commodities may make recycled materials less competitive under specific market conditions.

Transportation Cost: Transportation costs tend to be expensive and are mainly high in the recycling infrastructure-underdeveloped markets. Cardboard is an uncollapsed, bulky product and the longer distances traveled for processing tend to reduce the economic merits of recycling .

Market Segmentation
The global cardboard recycling market can be segmented based on several factors:
Type of Cardboard: This market is mainly divided into two kinds of cardboard

Corrugated Cardboard: This is the most used type of transporting and packaging products. The three layers to this kind are made to have a wavy center design for added strength and durability. Actually, corrugated cardboard is used the most when facilities recycle.
Boxboard/Cardboard: This is one of the most commonly used types of consumer goods-products like cereal boxes and other after-retail product packages. It is flexible and thinner compared to corrugated cardboard but recyclable.
End-user Industries:

Retail and E-commerce: The retail industry generates a substantial proportion of cardboard waste due to packaging materials used in the delivery process. E-commerce particularly has upped demand for recyclable cardboard packaging.
Manufacturing: Generally, industrial packaging packages much cardboard, particularly when shipping heavy good products. Recycling activities form the core of waste management for manufacturers.

Food and Beverage: Food and beverage packaging holds an even higher percentage in the cardboard recycling division. Even though cardboard packaging is highly used in the food industry, contamination poses a problem during the recyclage procedure; still, present trends in sustainability are now motivating the adoption of recyclable packaging solutions.
Geographic Regions:
North America: The USA and Canada are the foremost contributors in the cardboard recycling market primarily due to their well-established recycling infrastructures and regulatory policies.
Europe: Strong policies at government level and higher consumer awareness are two factors that make Europe boast some of the world's highest recycling rates. Countries recycling cardboard in high amounts include Germany, UK, and France.
Asia-Pacific: China was the largest importer of recyclable cardboard, but the "National Sword" policy banning foreign imports of waste from 2018 changed this. Instead, domestic recycling is booming in countries like Japan, South Korea, and India.
Rest of the World: Other regions, such as Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, are also moving forward with the development of recycling infrastructure. Logistical and regulatory issues have long been hallmarks of these regions.

Technology Advancements
Advances in recycling technologies are serving to add to the expansion of the cardboard recycling market:

Sorting using automation and AI: Cardboard is being sorted increasingly nowadays without wasting much time. The reason here is the advanced sensor technology combined with automation of robots, which can quickly and accurately identify recyclable materials, thereby leading to far more efficient recycling facilities.

Recycling Processing Innovation Improvements in recycling processes have led to recycling of inherently lower-quality cardboard and decreased reliance on virgin materials. Such innovations improve upon the reduction of contaminants and increase the yield of usable recycled material.

Bio-based Coatings and Additives: Recent breakthroughs in packaging coatings include bio-based coatings applied to cardboard making it easier to recycle. In the past, traditional wax or plastic would make recycling complicated. With this, bio-based alternatives ensure everything regarding packaging remains eco-friendly.

Outlook
The future is really bright for the global cardboard recycling market. More and more emphasis will be placed on sustainability and the circular economy. Key trends likely to shape the future include:

Circular Economy Programs: Countries and corporations are embracing the concept of a circular economy, through the retrieval of raw material from one product to be reused in another. The continuous cycle recycling of cardboard would aim to close the gap on materials use without depleting the natural resources.

Improving Packaging Regulations: The increased regulatory compliance toward packaging waste will increase acceptance of recyclable material in the form of cardboard among companies, further driving the demand for recycled cardboard and resulting in market growth.

Sustainability is a Competitive Advantage Brands are starting to use sustainability in order to differentiate themselves. Eco-friendly packaging that uses waste material will mean consumers have more confidence in and loyalty to a company.

Emerging Economies: Developing economies are still at a nascent stage of recycling infrastructure, but the growth prospect is substantial. Governments in the emerging economies are investing in waste management solutions while the rise in consumer awareness is expected to boost up the recycling rates during the forecasted period.
