# 2. Market Segmentation
The fanfold market can be segmented with several criteria:-
Material type: Thermal paper, corrugated paper, bond paper and carbonless paper.
Application: Packaging, labelling, business forms and others.
End-use industry: Retail, logistics, healthcare, food and beverage, and manufacturing.
a. Material Type
Thermal fanfold paper Thermal fanfold is the most common type of fanfold paper used in point of sale systems, receipts, and barcode labels. This is highly sensitive to heat, so ink is not absorbed and used for printing. Thermal fanfold is now widely used due to growing adoption of more automated checkout systems and thermal printers in many industries that help balance out environmental impacts brought about by label use.
Corrugated fanfold: Its use is mainly in packaging that is flexible and cheaper. It looks something like an accordion so it is easy to adjust the size for packaging with different measurements so there is no need for too many sizes of boxes.
Bond fanfold paper : Business forms or for any document that requires higher quality paper with a very smooth finish mostly requires use of bond paper.
Carbonless fanfold paper: This type is primarily used for multi-part business forms. Carbonless fanfold paper lets a user generate copies without carbon paper.
b. Applications
Packaging: Corrugated fanfold paper is generally consumed in packaging companies, with the bulk being used for shipping box, inserts, and padding production. With this medium, flexibility, easy handling, and waste reduction are achieved.
Labelling: Fanfold paper is highly used for labeling logistic and warehousing purposes. Because it can easily load into printers and carries on a continuous feed, it works perfectly for high volume applications.
Business forms: Of course, there are the traditional applications of fanfold paper, which are business documents such as invoice and receipts and forms. The sale of these products has not only dwindled but reduced significantly with further digitalization. Yet in some fields such as in healthcare and in logistics, there are still some usage. 
c. End-Use Industry
Retail and E-commerce: Online shopping has increased, and the demand for fanfold packaging materials has increased within significant limits. Companies look towards fanfold corrugated paper as store space is reduced and cost is saved in packaging.
Logistics and Warehousing: The sector of logistics uses labels of fans for tracking and inventory purposes. Corrugated fanfold material is also required for wrapping products during transportation.
Healthcare: Fanfold paper is used in medical record-keeping and laboratory forms. The thermal fanfold paper is commonly available in hospitals for the printing of patient wristbands, and medication labels.
Manufacturing: In massive packaging units, the fanfold materials are used for the shipping of products and managing inventory.

Volatility of raw material prices: Raw material, especially pulp and paper, has a volatile cost. This volatility makes the manufacturers less profitable as their revenue is affected whenever there is an increase in raw material prices. Companies are looking towards investments in recycling processes and using alternative materials instead of causing too much disruption due to price fluctuations.
Environmental regulations: Stricter government regulations on single-use materials are compelling firms to invest in more environmental-friendly alternatives. Even though this trend generates a growing demand for sustainable fanfold products, the long-term research and development is enormous.
